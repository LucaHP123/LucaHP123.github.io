            <p>I'm a competitive skier, artist, graphic designer, and soldier from Seattle, WA. I'm working towards completing my final year of university and spending weekends coaching the next generation of freeskiers at Alpental. I need to maintain a healthy work-life balance to feel fulfilled. The mountains inspire my creative flow, and my studies make me appreciate my time there. After completing my BA in graphic design, I aim to find an internship in graphic design or video making and continue serving in the Swiss Armed Forces. My Swiss heritage and time spent there have heavily influenced who I am today and continue to inspire my creative mindset and dictate how I approach life. I try to keep things simple, straightforward, and focused. My experiences in the military added to my ability to successfully address life's challenges and approach my goals with a step-by-step process. I hope to pass my knowledge and know-how on the others and guide them toward successful lives and careers.</p>
